what if an incharge is absent?
  Let me give an example,
               Assume there are 100 employees who are going to use the cab facility.Let us have 10 incharges.That is 1 incharge for 10 employees.
  I want to make clear that there is no particular incharge for an employee.Assinging the incharge is in first come first serve manner.The 1st employee
  who asks for a ride will be assigned with 1st incharge,2nd employee will be assigned with the 2nd incharge and so on.The 11th employee will be assigned 
  with the 1st incharge and it goes on.Whenever an incharge is not at work that incharge's slot will not be assigned for any employees.
 
What if an employee doesn't want to be traced by an incharge ?
       The employee can give access to an incharge for tracing the cab.If an employee have a problem with cab tracing,then he/she can refuse the access for
 tracing.  

What if the specified destination can't be navigated through map?
      Only in small villages,some addresses can't be navigated through map.So it is not going to be big problem.
